# Specific settings for the inftools software infinit.
# Infinit can create initial paths and optimize the interfaces given a single configuration file.
[infinit]
# Place the interfaces such that the local crossing probabilites are **at least** pL. The number of
# interfaces is determined by the number of workers and the current estimate of the total crossing
# probability. We place n_worker*2 interface with interfaces spaced such that the local crossing
# probabilites are equal. If they are lower than pL, we add additional interfaces such that it is
# **at least** pL. We can add a maximum number of interfaces by also specifying the variable 'num_ens'.
# For example,
#     num_ens = 14
# overwrites the behaiviour by pL and places **at most** 14 interfaces.
pL = 0.3
# The number of infretis steps to run between interfaces updates. In this case, we run 80 infretis steps,
# then we estimate the crossing proabilites using WHAM and place the interfaces as mentioned in the 'pL'
# settings section. The we pick out valid paths from the simulation we jut ran and give them as initial
# paths to the next infretis run, which will run for 160 steps.

cstep = -1
# Since 'cstep = -1' we have to give infinit the configuration to start the simulation from. If we
# give it a configuration with a rather large orderparameter value, we should also pump up the numbers

# When using 'sh' moves, paths can be rejected based on the early rejection scheme. This means that when
# a path that we currently are generating is longer than this value, the path generation is stopped and

# too long

delete_old = false
# If we want to start a main simulation with infretis, it could be wise to set 'delete_old = true'.
# Then, via the gromacs .mdp options, we can tell gromacs to also write .xtc files every N-steps.This
# can save some space. So .trr files are deleted because they correspond to the trajectory format of

In case you get an error when starting infretis that is engine-related, as the one below:

```sh-session
RuntimeError: Execution of external program (GROMACS engine zamn) failed with command:
 gmx_2024.4_gpu mdrun -ntomp 2 -ntmpi 1 -notunepme -nb gpu -bonded cpu -pme gpu -notunepme -s genvel.tpr -deffnm genvel -c genvel.g96.
Return code: 1
```

We can locate the `stderr.txt` and `stdout.txt` files to see what went wrong. These files are located in either `temporary_load/`, `gromacs_input`, or `workerX/`.

### Starting infinit from a previous MD simulation (GROMACS only)

In some cases, we might want to use an MD simulation as a starting point for our simulation instead of a single configuration. This allows us to immediately use N workers, instead of generating zero-paths with 1 worker, which can be tedious and doesn't immediately use all of the allocated hardware.

```bash
inft initial_path_from_md -trr md_run.trr -order order_rec.txt -toml infretis0.toml
```
Which generates a path `0/` and `1/`. To use $N > 1$ worker, we can copy the `1/` path $N-1$ times to the `load/` folder. For example, to use 6 workers I need to have paths `0/ 1/ 2/ 3/ 4/ 5/ 6/` in the `load/` folder, where now 6 of the paths are identical. Then, we must also add $N-1$ "temporary" interfaces to `infretis0.toml`

```toml
# lamres must then be a bit lower than 0.001, e.g. lamres = 0.0001
interfaces = [0.6, 0.601, 0.602, 0.603, 0.604, 0.605, 6.0] 
```

The `order_rec.txt` should correspond to an orderparameter file, which can be calculated with

```bash
inft recalculate_order -traj md_run.trr -toml infretis0.toml -out order_rec.txt
```

### Running an infinit simulation

```bash
# first time we call infinit
inft infinit -toml infretis0.toml
# to continue the simulation after changing some options (which have to be changed in both restart.toml
# and infretis.toml)
inft infinit -toml infretis.toml
```
